		<p>Hey! It's me, Parry Graff! Remember me from the "about us" page? I'm back! I want to talk about waffles. I'm still hungry. I didn't find anything to eat. In any case, waffles are depressed. I know this because they're actually pancakes that were made in a mold. Kind of like kids who go to school. Maybe that's why kids are surupy! I mean depressed! Anyways, waffles are depressed pancakes, and the only thing that can make them feel better is butter, syrup, or berries, if you have any. They're lonely. I guess you could also end their suffering if you don't have any of those. Nom Nom!</p>
